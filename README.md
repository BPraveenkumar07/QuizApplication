# QuizApplication
The Java code implements a console-based quiz application with two classes: `Quizapplication` and `Question`. `Quizapplication` manages the quiz flow, asking questions and scoring answers, while `Question` models each question with its options and correct answer. The app tracks and displays the userâ€™s final score.
